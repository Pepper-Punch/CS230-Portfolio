# Reflection 

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**  
The client was The Gaming Room, and they wanted a multiplayer gaming app called "Draw It or Lose It." The game needed to work across different platforms and use a client-server setup so multiple players could connect and play.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**  
I organized the project layout clearly and explained the client-server communication plan in a way that would be easy for both the client and the developers to understand.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**  
It forced me to think ahead about the structure before writing any code. Mapping out classes, functions, and flow early made the actual coding part more straightforward.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**  
I would probably improve the level of detail in the database design section. I could have included more examples of what the player data would look like and how it would be stored.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**  
I focused on making sure the game would be fast, easy to join, and able to run on multiple devices, since that's what the user would expect from a multiplayer game. It's important to design around what users actually need, or they’ll just quit using the software.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**  
I broke the project down into smaller pieces first (client side, server side, database), then built the design document around that. In the future, I would probably use more diagrams or flowcharts earlier to get a visual layout quicker.
